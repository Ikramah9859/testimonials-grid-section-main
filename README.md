## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 I learnt how to use CSS Grid layout for a two-dimensional flow.
 I also learnt Mobile responsiveness

```html
<div class="grid-container"></div>
  ```
```css
  .team-img{
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
    }
```

### Continued development

I look forward to improving and learning better coding. I would also loveto perfect my CSS knowledge so that I can do better with Javascript.
### Useful resources
